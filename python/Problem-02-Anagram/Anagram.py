#Anagram:
#Write a function that receives two words (String) and returns true or false (Bool) 
# depending on whether they are anagrams or not.
    # - An Anagram consists of forming a word by rearranging ALL the letters of another initial word.
    # - It is NOT necessary to check that both words exist.
    # - Two words exactly alike are not anagrams.
